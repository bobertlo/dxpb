- High Level:
   - Poked by git
   - Poke xbulk for 9 architectures.
   - Wait for another poke.
   - For now, rsync is still the way packages return to the repo.
- System layer:
   - The IRC Bot:
      - Be connected to IRC
      - When told that a build has completed, post details to IRC.
   - The Graph Server:
      - Listen on http for a webhook, then:
         - Find the packages changed
         - Send the package list to the Job Server
      - The Job Server:
         - Have 9 Work Servers
         - Wait for Work Servers to come online:
            - Add them to the list of active Work Servers
            - Instead of a list, there is a preconfigured set of "fingerprints",
               describing the workers, 1 Work Server per fingerprint.
            - If there are outstanding packages, make sure the work servers are
               notified.
         - Wait for lists of packages
            - Tell the Work Servers online that they should build.
            - Keep the list of packages if any workers are not presently
               connected.
         - Wait for a ping:
            - Mark the worker as currently active
         - Wait for a log:
            - Mark the worker as currently active
            - Write the log to file.
   - The Work Server:
      - Check in with the Job Server:
         - Every 30 seconds, ping.
      - Accept a poke:
         - Run an arbitrary script.
         - Send the output from the script to the job server.
- Finding the packages changed:
   - Have a git hash
   - Locate the most recent git hash
   - Diff the trees, finding dir names directly under /srcpkgs/
   - Save hash to database (boltdb)
